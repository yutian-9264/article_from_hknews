### Some comments I like:    

samwillis:

I'm very excited about what Matt is building, the world desperately  needs a good open source parametric CAD package. One where the UI/UX is  designed to be as "easy" to use a SolidWorks.

The biggest reason this  hasn't happened so far is the lack of a truly capable parametric kernel, Truck, the kernel that Matt is using looks like an incredible project  and exactly whats needed. The only other kennel till now that been close to being whats needed is OpenCascade, but its lacks important features, is buggy and at times quite unstable.

Once Truck (and CADmium)  lands stable fillets (surprisingly one of the hardest features to make  stable) it will prove itself as the perfect successor to OpenCascade and and the perfect platform to build the future of open source parametric  CAD upon.

### use chatgpt to write a overview:

The article discusses CADmium, a new open-source, browser-based CAD  program designed for local-first use. Key components include a 2D  constraint solver, B-rep kernel, history tracker, and a user-friendly 3D interface. CADmium leverages modern technologies like Rust and  webassembly to enhance performance and accessibility. The project aims  to provide a robust and flexible CAD experience, contrasting with  existing solutions by focusing on iterative problem solving and ease of  use. The article invites collaboration and highlights ongoing  development needs and future goals.
