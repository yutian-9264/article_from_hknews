The article "From the Circle to Epicycles (Part 1)" on Andrei N. Ciobanu's blog provides an animated introduction to Fourier series. It explores the concept of representing complex periodic functions as sums of simple sine and cosine waves. Through detailed animations and explanations, the author demonstrates how these series can be used to approximate various shapes and signals, emphasizing the historical development from basic circular motion to the more complex epicycle models used in ancient astronomy. This visual approach aims to make the mathematical principles more accessible and engaging for readers, particularly those with an interest in mathematics and its applications in various fields.
