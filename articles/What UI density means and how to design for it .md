This explains exactly why physical restaurant menus are so much better  vs mobile site menus. If I'm viewing the menu of a restaurant on my  phone, I always look in Google Maps for someone who took a picture of  the menu, because it's a dense UI. Every "mobile friendly" menu site is  able to show maybe 5 items on the page at once, so it takes many pages  of scrolling to see everything.

Matthew Ström's article on UI density discusses how interface design has evolved to become less visually dense over time. Ström defines UI  density as the amount of information an interface provides over time,  emphasizing the importance of visual, information, design, and temporal  densities. He explains that effective design maximizes value density by  providing high-value outcomes with minimal time and space. Ström also  highlights Gestalt principles and Edward Tufte's data-ink ratio as key  concepts in achieving optimal UI density.
