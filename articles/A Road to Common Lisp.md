### use chatgpt to write a overview:

teve Losh's article, "A Road to Common Lisp," chronicles his journey of  learning and adopting Common Lisp, a powerful yet underappreciated  programming language. He explores the rich history of Lisp, noting its  stability and practical utility despite its reputation for complexity.  Losh emphasizes Lisp's robustness, highlighting its backward  compatibility and extensibility. He also delves into the language's  unique features, such as macros and the Common Lisp Object System  (CLOS), which provide immense flexibility and power. Ultimately, Losh's  experience underscores the value of Lisp for serious programmers willing to invest the time to master it.
