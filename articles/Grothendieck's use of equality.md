### Some comments I like:    

eru:
Yes.  0/1, 0/2, 0/3 are all different in some sense, but they belong in the same equivalence class.              

### use chatgpt to write a overview:

The paper "Grothendieck's use of equality" by Kevin Buzzard discusses  how mathematicians, particularly Grothendieck, use the concept of  equality in their work. It examines the impact of this usage on the  formalization of mathematics and challenges several common assumptions  about equality. The paper is a write-up of a talk given at a conference  and explores the philosophical and logical implications of equality in  mathematical practice.
