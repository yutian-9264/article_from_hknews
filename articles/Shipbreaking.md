"Shipbreaking" by Edward Burtynsky captures the stark realities of dismantling massive ocean vessels in shipbreaking yards. Through hauntingly beautiful yet sobering photographs, Burtynsky illuminates the environmental and human impact of this industry, documenting the collision between industrial progress and ecological consequences. His images compel viewers to confront the complexities of global trade, consumption, and labor practices, prompting reflection on the cost of modernity.
