With enough of these submission titles lacking any kind of useful description, HN is just going to be a random click-lottery.

No one seems to care though and it's becoming increasingly frequent, maybe I'm in the wrong place.

This was pretty fascinating. I actually still have my 128K Mac, as well  as an Apple sweatshirt, that my dad bought for me in 1985. I lugged that sucker around university. Last I looked (about 8 years ago) it had some kind of boot error, not sure if it's the same one as Giogi's. Now I'm  tempted to unearth it and revisit.

### use chatgpt to write a overview:

The website "84-24.org" documents the restoration and first boot attempt of a Macintosh 128K computer, originally released in 1984. The article describes the excitement of receiving the vintage computer, its unboxing, and the initial power-up sequence. Despite preparing extensively by watching repair videos, the author encounters a "Sad Mac" icon indicating a hardware error, identified by the specific error code "04040A." The article delves into the diagnostic process, interpreting the code to trace the issue to specific memory chips on the motherboard. The narrative highlights both the challenges and the nostalgic appeal of reviving an iconic piece of computing history.
