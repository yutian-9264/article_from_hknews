### Some comments I like:    

criddell:

For me, school was mostly frustrating.

I  loved kindergarten and first and second grades which mostly seemed to be play. I think it was effective for me as far as creativity and  socialization goes.

From third grade through high school I was  bored with most of the material. A lot of it was not interesting and  sometimes the pace was too slow.

At university, the work load was  too high. I think if I had taken six years to complete the 4 year  program, I would have been a lot better off. Too often I didnâ€™t have the time to really dig into the material and explore related ideas (side  quests). Instead I settled for memorization which was enough to do well  on exams. My GPA at graduation did not reflect my command of the  material.

Like Andy, I think an AI-powered course of learning  could be great. The strength, I think, would be its adaptability. If  while learning topic A I stumble across an interesting idea, it would  have no problem with changing course and running down topic B.
