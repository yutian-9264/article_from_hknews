### use chatgpt to write a overview:

The article "Coding my Handwriting" by Amy Goodchild describes her  process of creating cursive handwriting using JavaScript and p5.js.  Initially dismissing the idea as too complex, she eventually designed  and encoded cursive letters by defining key points and smoothing paths.  Goodchild outlines the technical challenges and solutions for joining  letters smoothly, the adjustments needed for different letter pairs, and how she used her tool for generating and visualizing the cursive text.
