"The Lunacy of Artemis" by Maciej Ceg≈Çowski critically examines NASA's  Artemis program, highlighting its reliance on outdated technology,  significant delays, and budget overruns. The article argues that the  program's use of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft is  inefficient and costly. It also critiques the Near Rectilinear Halo  Orbit (NRHO) and the Gateway station as unnecessary complications. The  piece suggests that NASA's current approach is unsustainable and that  fundamental changes are needed to achieve successful space exploration.
